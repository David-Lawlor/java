Ground control to major tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
Ground control to major tom
Commencing countdown engines on
check ignition and may god be with you
this is ground control to major tom
you've really made the grade
And the papers wants to know who's shirt you wear
now its time to leave the capsule if you dear
This is major tom to ground control
im stepping through the door
and im floating in the most peculiar way
and the stars look very different today
for here
and i'm sitting in a tin can
far above the world
Planet earth is blue and there's nothing i can do
though im passed one hundred thousand miles
im feeling very skilled
and i think my spaceship know which way to go
tell my wife i love her very much she know
Ground control to major tom
your circuits dead theres something wrong
can you hear me major tom
can you hear
and my floating round tin can
far above the moon
Planet earth is blue and there's nothing i can do
